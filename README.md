CS 7641 Assignment 1: Supervised Learning Classification
This file describes the structure of this assignment submission.
For testing on your own machine, you need only to install python 3.6.0 and the following packages:
	â€¢	pandas, numpy, random, scikit-learn, matplotlib, itertools, timeit

Dataset
Dataset1. borrower_table.csv, which is a dataset used in a private project and erased all the confidential data
Dataset2. telescope.csv, http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/magic/  (I merged the data to a csv file)
Please save the datasets to your local machine and change the current directory to a file where you have the data stored.

Running the Classifiers
1. ImportData_and_helper.py;  This python script import all the python packages, two datasets , and all the helper functions for graphs. Please run it first
2. DecisionTree.py; Code for Decision Tree experiments
3. NeuralNetwork.py; Code for Neural nets experiments
4. Boosting.py; Code for boosted decision tree experiments
5. SVM.py; Code for support vector machine experiments
6. Knn.py; Code for kNN experiments
